Attmail - Send Mails from Shell with attachments using sendmail.

Parameters:
	attmail [From] [To] [Subject] [Body] [Attachment1] [Attachment2] ... [AttachmentX]

Depends on the following applications to be installed and working:
 	- sendmail
	- file (should be preinstalled)
 
I am aware of the fact that sendmail isn't ideal, but it was the only application available on the webserver I wrote this code for.

Loosely based on Code from the following Site:
http://www.unix.com/aix/177948-how-send-attachment-using-sendmail-command-without-uuencode-command.html (Sendmail-Code)
